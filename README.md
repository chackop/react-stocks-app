# Stock App

This is a stock app that leverages the finhub api that displays basic stock symbol and candle data

Currently the candle data is applied on a stacked bar graph

## Demo

Please see the following GIF of basic usage of the app:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Future Enhancements

A future enhancement would be to have a single candle bar graph that takes all the data


## Troubleshoot

If Finhub APIs are failing due to its reaching its call limit you can generate a new finhub API key and use it under the constants file
